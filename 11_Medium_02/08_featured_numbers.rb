A featured number (something unique to this exercise) is a number with
the following properties:

- it is odd
- it is a multiple of 7
- all its digits occur once each

Examples:

- 49 is a featured number,
- but 98 is not (it is not odd),
- 97 is not (it is not a multiple of 7), and
- 133 is not (the digit 3 appears twice).

Write a method that takes a single integer as an argument, and returns the next featured number that is greater than the argument. Issue an error message if there is no next featured number.
