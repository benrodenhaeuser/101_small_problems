task 1:

write method `egyptian`:

given rational number x, returns array of denominators [a_1, ..., a_n]

such that 1/a_1 + 1/a_2 + 1/a_n = x

task 2:

write method `unegyptian`:

given array of denominators [a_1, ..., a_n], returns rational number x such that 1/a_1 + 1/a_2 + 1/a_n = x

background:

- rational number: fractions ("any number that can be represented as the result of the division between two integers"). 2/3 â€” numerator/denominator
- unit fraction: numerator is 1
- egyptian fraction: sum of distinct unit fractions.

- Law: Every rational number can be written as an Egyptian fraction
