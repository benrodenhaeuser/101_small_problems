# Write a method that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. (The first Fibonacci number has index 1.)

# in other words we want to implement the function f
# which is defined by f(x) = y
# iff y is the smallest number such that the length of fibonacci(y) in digits is x

approach:

- first step: examples:

fibo_index(1) should return 1 because 1 is the smallest number such that fibonnaci(1) has length 1
fibo_index(2) should return 6 because 6 is the smallest number such that fibonnaci(?) has length 1

- "brute force": we compute the full fibonacci sequence until we hit one that has the length given as an argument
- that is: given length_in_digits x
  - compute fibonacci(1) â€” if it has length x, return 1
  - compute fibonacci(2) - if it has length x, return 2
  - and so on
- this can be implemented roughly as follows:

  input argument: number_of_digits

  index = 1
  while length_of(fibonacci(index)) < number_of_digits
    index += 1
  end
  index

- we see that we need a method that computes the length of a number, and we need to
  implement above method
